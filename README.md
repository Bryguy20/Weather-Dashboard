# Weather-Dashboard

## The Weather-Dashboard will help a user see the current forecast for the week in the city the user lives in and also in the console show longitude and latitude. Also the wind speed and chart.

# The movation for me making the weather-dashboard is to help the users see the forecast in a matter of mintues and also when they travel to a different city. It also the user can see where they are in the world because it shows longitude and latitude. Also to know if it's gonna be really hot to put on sunblock or even a little cold to bring a hoodie to go.
